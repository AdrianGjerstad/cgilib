# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the current version of this library will recieve security updates, as
they will take the form of typical updates with an additional identifier
for security update version. For example:

- `1.0.1-4520b` is the second security update for the forty-fifth week of
  2020 under main version `1.0.1`
- `1.3.2-0321c` is the third security update for the third week of 2021
  under main version `1.3.2`

Because of this please make sure you keep the most updated version that you
can.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is still under review, as I need to learn how to do it myself. If you
manage to have a crisis with the current state of this project...

*how?*
