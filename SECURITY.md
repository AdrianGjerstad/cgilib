# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the current version of this library will recieve security updates, as
they will take the form of typical updates with an additional identifier
for security update version. For example:

  2020 under main version `1.0.1`

  under main version `1.3.2`

Because of this please make sure you keep the most updated version that you
can.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We make every effort we can to stop vulnerabilites before they're
prematurely disclosed to the public. To do that, we need people who can
look out for such threats, and report them.

If you find a threat that you believe to still be in a current release,
please send an email to cppcgilibsecurity@googlegroups.com. In your email
please provide a description of the type of attack it reveals, and what
you may recommend to fix it. Every recommendation helps, so, if you want
search through our code and find every little thing you can!
